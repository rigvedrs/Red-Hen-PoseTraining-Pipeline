In a dramatically unstable pose between her knees, a Child Jesus with an elongated body transforms the jocular movements of a putto into a tragic contortion of the limbs and of the smile, in the awareness of his destiny which is matched by a range of colours unusually cold for Andrea, based on subtle relations between grey and violet.",1501-1550,Oil on wood,200.0

Images of St Sebastian bound to a tree and pierced with arrows had become increasingly popular from the fifteenth century on, partly because they gave artists an excuse to depict the male nude within a religious context. The inclusion of an angel tending the saint's wounds is very rare, but undoubtedly reflects devotional literature that recounted how Christ sent an angel to untie Sebastian and cure his wounds. The angel can also be linked to the contemporary cult of guardian angels, who were believed to take the outward appearance of youthful boys. Similar guardian angels can be found in Caravaggio's Stigmatisation of St Francis (Wadsword Atheneum, Hartford), Orazio Gentileschi's St Francis Supported by an Angel (Museo del Prado, Madrid), and Baglione's own St Francis Comforted by Two Angels (Private collection), which is dated 1601.",1601-1650,Oil on canvas,200.0

But what he did not do was to show off cleverness for its own sake. The way that he accurately describes a number of details (the fruits, the metal objects, or the items in the bottom left corner) foreshadows the imminent developments that would give rise to the new (for Italy) genre of still-lifes.

Nor is it only in the type of picture that the Budapest Madonna is related to  Leonardo. The subtlety of the detail, for instance the beauty of Mary's hands, the tender pose of the heads and the accomplished execution of the rich drapery, all provide evidence that the link with Leonardo is more than a matter of inspiration or borrowing of motifs.

At that time, the order's two founders, Felix de Valois and Jean de Matha, had not yet been canonised. They could only be worshiped in public after 1666, once the process had been completed. This did not mean, however, that a cult could not develop around them earlier. The order, established for the express purpose of buying the freedom of Christian slaves, was consecrated to the Holy Trinity. One of the most important 'new' saints of the period was Carlo Borromeo, who had been canonised in 1610. Borromeo came from Milan, which was then under Spanish rule. The Trinitarians, too, had close ties with Spain, and between 1598 and 1606 Borgianni himself had spent time in Pamplona, Madrid, Valladolid and Toledo.

Christ's physical agony is heightened by the spike-studded wooden blocks which dangle fore and aft from his waist, lacerating his feet and ankles with every step. This cruel device was frequently represented by Dutch artists well into the sixteenth century. The high horizon is old-fashioned, as is the lack of spatial recession in the middle distance. In the foreground, soldiers torment the bad thief while the good thief kneels before a priest. The almost frantic intensity of his confession, well-expressed by the open-mouthed profile, contrasts vividly with the passive response of the priest who seems to suppress a yawn.

It is generally considered to be a late work and one of Bosch's greatest creations. The antithesis between good and evil, which was so crucial to Christian belief in Bosch's time, is raised to a climax. The painting is a peerless study of human facial expressions and demonic visages. Yet the chaotic and caricatured elements are never overwhelming and the painting seems to observe a complex balance of parallels and contrasts that emphasizes the serenity of Christ's gently modelled face in the centre.

One such work is the Christ Carrying the Cross in the Palacio Real, Madrid. Christ dominates the foreground, almost crushed beneath the heavy Cross which the elderly Simon of Cyrene struggles to lift from his back. The ugly heads of his executioners rise steeply in a mass towards the left; in the distance, the sorrowing Virgin collapses into the arms of John the Evangelist. Whereas Bosch's earlier composition of this subject in Vienna had been diffuse and primarily narrative, the Madrid version is concentrated, and the way that Christ ignores his captors to look directly at the spectator gives it the quality of a timeless devotional image.",1451-1500,Oil on panel,200.0

Both clutch crucifixes and are making their final confessions to the cowled priests beside them. The thieves, their confessors and the ghoulish spectators who surround the cart are all in contemporary dress. In Bruegel's day public executions were well attended occasions which had the air of festivals or carnivals. Here Bruegel shows the absolute indifference of the gawping crowds to the fear and misery of the condemned men.

Patenier's followers - in particular Herri met de Bles, Matthys Cock (the brother of Bruegel's print publisher, Hieronymus) and Cornelis Massys - had turned his style into a popular but stale formula. The sequence of Bruegel's landscape drawings and of the landscape in his paintings shows the gradual abandonment of this formula.

On this occasion, however, there are none of the usual signs of a religious scene such as a halo. A young girl, seen from above, is seated on a low stool in one of Caravaggio's favourite cave-like settings, with a triangle of light high up on the wall behind her. Discarded jewellery - a string of pearls, clasps, a jar (perhaps holding precious ointment) - lies on the floor. The girl's hair is loose, as if it has just been washed. Her costume, consisting of a white-sleeved blouse, a yellow tunic and a flowery skirt, is rich. Bellori, who gives a careful description of this picture, which he came across in the collection of Prince Pamphilj, regards its title as an excuse; for him it is just a naturalistic portrayal of a pretty girl. This seems to show a willful failure to understand Caravaggio's intention or the wishes of the man who commissioned it, Monsignor Petrignani. The repentant Mary Magdalene, like the repentant Peter, was a favourite subject of Counter-Reformation art and poetry, which valued the visible expression of the state of contrition 'the gift of tears'. Caravaggio's heroine is sobbing silently to herself and a single tear falls down her cheek. She is, as it were, poised between her past life of luxury and the simple life she will embrace as one of Christ's most faithful followers. It is a sign of the painter's skill that he makes this inner conflict moving at the same time as he makes its representation delectable.",1551-1600,Oil on canvas,200.0

The decorative scheme called for a statue of St Matthew and the Angel, commissioned first to Gerolamo Muziano, and then to the Flemish sculptor Cobaert, for the high altar; and for a fresco cycle for the walls and ceiling by Cavalier d'Arpino. The latter decorated the vault in 1591-93, but the walls were left bare (this may reflect at least in part the Crescenzis' intentions to speculate on the interest on the Contarelli estate). On 13 June 1599 a contract was stipulated before a notary by which Caravaggio undertook to execute two paintings for the lateral walls, for which he was paid the following year (1600), after the paintings had been set in place. Later, on 7 February 1602, after Cobaert's statue had been judged unsatisfactory, an altarpiece was entrusted to Caravaggio in a separate contract that called for delivery of the work by 32 May, the Feast of the Pentecost.

Among the Latin Fathers of the Church he was a powerful ally against modern heretics, who attacked the cult of the saints, restricted the use of Latin to the learned and viewed the papacy as the whore of Babylon.

This is probably what led to a relationship between the cardinal and the Emilian painter, resulting in the former commissioning a painting entitled Domine quo vadis? (now in the National Gallery in London) from the artist the following year. He also asked him to decorate, between 1603 and 1604, six lunettes in his private chapel. This no longer exists, but at the time was located in what is today the private entrance to the apartment of Palazzo Doria Pamphilj al Corso. An old plan shows that it had three entrances and six walls of different sizes, two large, two middle-sized, and two small, on which the six lunettes were placed. The Flight into Egypt, one of the two biggest, was probably located on the wall in front of the altar, to the right of the entrance that led into what is now the Aldobrandini room. It is very likely that Annibale Carracci had made the designs for all six of the canvases, but when he fell ill in 1605, the commission passed to his assistant Francesco Albani, who received the first payment in that year. Shortly afterwards, on May 21 1606, Pietro Aldobrandini, who had fallen out with Paul V, left Rome and did not return until 1610.

The Trinitarian order had been founded in the late twelfth century by the Frenchman John of Matha, and the altarpiece illustrates a key moment in his career. As St John of Matha raised the host during his first mass, he saw a vision of a young boy dressed in white (here converted into an angel), with arms crossed and hands resting on the heads of two prisoners, one a Christian, one a Moor.

He shared their aversion to academy-taught classicism and saw the work of Raphael as a guide. The influence of Raphael's work was decisive in his efforts to revitalize religious art and can be seen in the most important religious pictures of his Roman period: The Wise and the Foolish Virgins (c. 1813, Museum Kunstpalast, D√ºsseldorf) and the Entombment (1819; Copenhagen, Thorvaldsens Museum, Copenhagen), which was based on Raphael's treatment of the subject (Galleria Borghese, Rome).",1801-1850,Oil on canvas,200.0

For this small altarpiece, Correggio draws inspiration from a miraculous episode narrated in the apocryphal gospel of pseudo-Matthew: Mary stopped to rest under a date palm and, seeing it full of fruits, she asked Joseph to pick some. However, considering the fruits were too high to reach, Joseph replied they should rather think about finding some water. Jesus then asked the palm to bend its branches so they could refresh themselves with its fruits, and at its roots there appeared a spring of clear water. Correggio paints the moment when Joseph, still holding a branch, offers Jesus some fruits. The intimate dimension of the event is rendered in the serenity of affections within the family group in everyday life, amidst luxuriant natural surroundings (in this case the welcoming shade of the palm tree and of the oak grove).",1501-1550,Oil on canvas,200.0

David deemphasized this miracle by giving Joseph a sturdy stick and by replacing the date palm with a Flemish chestnut tree, but a sixteenth¬ñcentury audience would have remembered the apocryphal story. There are also indications of the special significance of the family: the Madonna wears robes in her symbolic colours of red and blue; fine rays of golden light emanate from the mother's head and that of the child; and the bunch of grapes held by the Madonna is a well¬ñknown symbol of the Eucharist.",1501-1550,Oil on panel,200.0

As he pursued a magnificent stag or hart, the animal turned and Hubert was astounded to see a crucifix floating between its antlers. He heard a voice saying: ""Hubert, unless thou turnest to the Lord and leadest a holy life, thou shalt quickly go down into Hell."" Hubert dismounted and prostrated himself, and after asking ""Lord, what wouldst Thou have me do?"" is told, ""Go and seek Lambert, and he will instruct you.""

The paintings by Altdorfer and Lucas Cranach the Elder give the scene a magical, fairy-tale quality. The artist's conception of nature at that period was, of course, quite different from that of today. In the sixteenth century the forest was not seen as romantic, but rather as a place fraught with hidden dangers; a century later, when Elsheimer painted his Holy Family, nothing had changed. The angels and the figure of Joseph, even the treatment of light, were clearly inspired by Altdorfer's pictures, but the way in which the heavenly messengers descend to protect the travellers and light up the dark forest reveals the first traces of Baroque art.",1551-1600,Oil on copper,200.0

Cycles of paintings on the life of the Virgin were very common in 17th-century Spanish art. These series sometimes consisted of twelve scenes, one for each star, with each illustrating one of the twelve gozos or sung poems of Mary, just as each star reminded the believer to pray a Hail Mary. The present set is related to Madrid on account of a specific iconographic detail. In all these scenes the Virgin's head is surrounded by a halo formed by the twelve stars of St John's vision in the Apocalypse, as if it were a representation of the Immaculate Conception, whereas the other figures display the usual halos of unbroken lines. In the case of Mary this distinction is based on devotion to the Immaculate Conception and was very common in Madrid painting during the reign of the last Habsburg king.",1701-1750,Oil on canvas,200.0

Efforts were made, for example, to attract Guercino and Albani to the English court, but the former declined on the basis that England was officially a Protestant country and that the climate was too inclement, and negotiations with the latter came to nothing. Indeed, a similar situation pertained during the reign of Charles II when the only Italian artist at court was Guercino's nephew, Benedetto Gennari, an inferior painter who worked in England from 1674. Significantly, when Orazio Gentileschi came to England in 1626 his main employer seems to have been Charles I's wife, Henrietta Maria, the daughter of Marie de' Medici, who continued to profess her Catholic faith after her marriage in 1625. For the queen Gentileschi painted the ceiling of the Great Hall in The Queen's House at Greenwich - Allegory of Peace and the Arts under the English Crown (now in Marlborough House, London) - and other important pictures by him are recorded at Greenwich such as The Finding of Moses (given by Charles I to Philip IV of Spain in 1633) and Joseph and Potiphar's Wife.

It was developed over the decades through numerous examples by Memling, David, and their followers. Such examples invariably showed youthful angels, however, rather than putti, which were far more common in North Italian painting of the period. Mantegna's San Zeno Altarpiece, or another example of its type which Gossart had seen during his Italian sojourn in 1508-09 may well have provided Gossart with a precedent for the close pose and placement of the putti at the base of the Virgin's throne.",1501-1550,Oil on oak panel,200.0

Unlike Joos, who placed his Holy Family in a modest domestic interior or before a parapet with Joseph reading devotional texts, Gossart envisaged Joseph, Mary, and the Christ Child at the edge of an enclosed palace courtyard where angels and elegant ladies intermingle.

El Greco had clearly already decided upon the dominant colour for the painting. The painting was completed by 16th November 1582, when it was delivered to the Escorial. The commission was probably prompted by the death of Navarrete in 1579, who left unfulfilled the greater part of his commission to provide paintings for the thirty-six altars of the church. The painting did not satisfy the King, Cincinato was commissioned to paint a substitute for the chapel and El Greco received no further commissions from the King.",1551-1600,Oil on canvas,200.0

Later, in Rome, he was strongly influenced by the work of Michelangelo. By the time he had settled in Toledo around 1576, his art was fully developed.

Though 'brother' could here apply to any male relation, it came to be taken in the strict sense and was the source of the tradition that represents Christ and the saint somewhat alike in appearance. This similarity is helpful in identifying St James in scenes such as the Last Supper. It was sometimes given as the reason for the kiss of Judas, because the soldiers then knew which man to arrest. According to early sources James was martyred by being thrown from the roof of the Temple and then stoned and beaten to death.

Because he came from Cana, he is also known as the Canaanite or Cananaean. Like the other apostles, after Pentecost Simon vanished from view. Most or less trustworthy legends place his missionary work in Egypt.

In it he follows a balanced compositional structure that had been developed earlier by the Carracci. The painting differs from a preparatory sketch - kept at Brera in Milan - by a stricter application of symmetry: both in the upper register, with the Madonna and the angels at the same height, and below, where Saints Louis of France, Joseph, Francis of Assisi and Augustine, the patron saint of the church in question, direct Mary's attention on both sides to the donor, and in the other direction point his devotion upwards to her in a double arc.",1601-1650,Oil on canvas,200.0

There is no doubt that this was the most important painting Guercino produced in his early years. He took great trouble preparing it and worked from careful studies and pencil sketches. The structure of the composition was highly original. The figures are arranged along the sides of an invisible lozenge, leaving the centre of the painting empty. The use of light and shade emphasized both the very delicate colours (right through to the candid white robes of the brother on the right) and the deeply dark areas.

With the death of the pope in 1623 he returned to Cento, where he pursued a successful career providing easel paintings to clients throughout Europe. He resisted offers from the French and English kings to work at their courts. After the death of Reni he moved to Bologna where he became the leading painter.

She is the embodiment of French academic classicism and could serve in comparable guise in many other pictures of the period.

The theme became popular in the 16th century and remained so after the Counter-Reformation in spite of some disapproval by the Church because of its apocryphal character.

In the lower part, the artist has represented the Apostles grouped around the Virgin's empty tomb. The impulse towards realism is evident in the way in which the artist has attempted to individualize the expressions and poses of each figure, as they show their surprise and awe at the miracle. He also organizes the group around the tomb into a more or less coherent spatial arrangement. The tomb, with its plain classical decoration, and in particular the lid which has fallen into the foreground space, give the scene a sensation of depth and realism, which contains otherwise little to indicate its setting: only a patch of green in the background represents what might be the side of a mountain.",1451-1500,Oil on panel,200.0

A date of 1622 was proposed for the picture on the basis of stylistic analogies with Lanfranco's Saint Margherita of Cortona, signed and dated by the artist in 1622 (Galleria Palatina, Palazzo Pitti, Florence). The Saint Ursula does not belong to the most refined and elegant phase of Lanfranco's career (1618-20), but rather to a slightly later phase of around 1622-24.

Leicher, who worked in Vienna, was a pupil and proteg√© of the Piarists. He worked a lot for them, and made several altarpieces with the representation of St. Joseph of Calasance (1556-1648), the founder of the order. who was canonized in 1767. These pictures mainly refer to the educational activity of the order, and show the saint in a circle of pupils, as he recommends them to the patronage of Mary and the little Jesus who are appearing among the clouds. The theme is the same with this devout Tata painting: the boys, who wear the fashionable clothes of the time, are accompanied by St. Joseph and their guarding angel. The lighting of the picture which draws the spectator's look upwards, the  expressive gestures, and the sweet, mild faces call to mind the art of Leicher's master, Franz Anton Maulbertsch. The Tata picture is one of the most harmonious works of Leicher in Hungary. He repeated this theme, with larger dimension and a changed composition, in Brezn√≥'s Piarist church (today Parish church) as well as in the altarpieces of the Nikolsburg (Mikoluv), Beneschau (Bensov u Prahy) and Nagyk√°roly (Carei) Piarist churches.

Behind Bernard, in the dark reaches of the rock, are two chained demons, while in the zone above, Cistercian monks converse or look heavenward in front of their fine Renaissance abbey. Still higher in the composition, a sick old man is being carried down toward the building. On the other side, a sweet landscape sweeps the eye into the distance.",1451-1500,Oil on panel,200.0

The presence of these is due to the dedication of the altar, but there may also have been a personal meaning for Lotto.

But in contrast to St Jerome pictures by Bellini and by other Venetian painters such as Cima and Lotto, Mansueti packs his composition with an enormous amount of further detail: a bear, a stoat, a dog, a deer, a rabbit, two monkeys, and two leopards in the foreground; a shepherd with sheep and cows in the right middleground; a river with gondoliers, washerwomen, swans and ducks, also in the middleground; and winding roads, with a man and his donkey, and other men walking and riding, leading the eye to a church, a castle, and distant mountains in the background.

All manner of artists flocked into the town on the Scheldt. One of these was Quentin Massys from Louvain, who registered as a painter in the St. Lucas Guild in 1491, and is regarded as the founder of the Antwerp School which was soon to topple the hegemony of the School of Bruges. He remained faithful to the Flemish tradition, although the sfumato in the background of some of his landscapes shows that he was familiar with the work of Leonardo da Vinci. He is usually regarded as a painter of monumental works, and rightly so, but he also painted smaller scale scenes with figures. This is hardly surprising, since his technique had its sources in miniature paintings. The Holy Virgin with the Child Jesus, a small tondo, bears witness to the attention the master paid to sensitive, finely detailed drawing to express the tender movement of the form, and the subtle use of colour to convey the essence of a variety of textures.",1451-1500,Oil on panel,200.0

We are invited to marvel at the humility of Mary, a modest - if surprisingly well-to-do - townswoman; at her maternal devotion - she does not rely on a nursemaid to care for her child; and at the tender affection between her and her son. More profoundly, we are led to reflect on the Incarnation: Christ has truly become man, touching his genitals like like any baby boy. His mother is without doubt the Virgin, for she wears her hair loose like an unmarried girl or a queen at her coronation. Haloes radiate from both their heads.

It is an emblematic representation intended as the object of meditation rather than the portrayal of an episode from the Gospels. Similarly, the Arma Christi in the background should be interpreted as signs of the Passion. Several emblems are included, in addition to obvious attributes such as the Cross, on which hangs the dark-purple robe from Christ's Mockery; the post from the flagellation with its rope, rods and flails; the cane and sponge, the spear, the hammer and nails.

The position of the Child in his mother's hands is somewhat reminiscent in type of Hugo van der Goes' little painting of the Virgin in Frankfurt (St√§delsches Kunstinstitut). The origins of this type are to be found in the Fl√©malle circle, which means that Memling might also have been inspired by a composition of that master. We find the same tile pattern in Van der Weyden's Annunciation in the Louvre, and in the Presentation in the Temple (Washington, National Gallery of Art) by a follower of Van der Weyden, now known as the Master of the Prado Adoration. By contrast, the arcade opening onto the landscape, which lends horizontal rhythm to the composition, is a pure Memling invention. An interesting detail in the landscape is the church on the right, which could be the abbey church of Seligenstadt, Memling's birthplace. The architectural significance of the second row of small columns of a different type, which stands behind the parapet and supports a beam, is less plain.

He was raised to the rank of cardinal, and given a faithful companion in the shape of a lion, from whose paw he was said to have removed a thorn. During his life as a hermit in the Syrian desert, Jerome sought to banish his sinful thoughts by chastising himself. The motif of the saint beating his chest with a stone was probably inspired by Italian examples, although no clear prototype springs to mind. Nevertheless, this still appears to be the first Netherlandish work to present on such a monumental scale a subject that was to become one of art's iconographical mainstays from the sixteenth century onwards. Interestingly, several similar paintings, possibly influenced by Memling, were produced in Bruges around this period and immediately afterwards. The saint kneels before a crucifix, bearded and bald, with the dark brown robe of the penitent about his naked body. His figure is tall and slim, and almost fills the foreground of the painting. Small, transparent droplets of blood well up from his bruised chest. His scarlet cardinal's cloak and hat lie on the ground behind him, as if he had just cast them off.

Nevertheless, it is an interesting little work which corresponds fully with Memling's style and spatial approach. The composition derives from Rogier van der Weyden. It portrays the episode in which Jerome removes the thorn from the lion's paw. The architectural setting is a characteristic Memling invention. The scene is viewed through a heavy round arch in brown stone, positioned at an angle close to the picture plane.

The throne in St Osyth is not, however, white but amber coloured and is profusely decorated with tracery, foliage and trails, and little sculptures in white stone. The sculpture that tops the throne represents the archangel expelling Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. The link with the Incarnation as the work's principal theme is clear. Recent cleaning showed the painting to be less damaged than had initially been feared, and uncovered the uppermost part of the house that can be made out hazily through the stained glass of the right window.

They were cut down to matching size obviously before 1656. The Virgin, who is clearly standing up as she reaches the height of the column capitals and does not have the Child on her lap, has been cut in half. The donors, who are kneeling, have been trimmed at the top and bottom to more or less the same height. It is extremely difficult after so much time to determine why the painting was mutilated in this way. The darker colour to the man's right, and above all the red drapery to the woman's left, seem to be original, at least in part and are thus likely to be remnants of the patron saints who originally stood alongside the donors . The hypothesis that the three paintings originally belonged to a single fixed panel is strengthened by the half dowel-holes that are still to be seen on the inner edges of the portraits. The three panels are thus fragments of the original vertical planks of the painting, which were linked by internal dowel pegs. We ought, therefore, to imagine a composition similar to the Virgin with donor in Ottawa, but with an extra figure on the opposite side. If there was a little more space above the Virgin, the original panel must have measured roughly 100 x 100 cm.",1451-1500,Oil on oak panel,200.0

Like Quentin Massys, with whom he worked occasionally, he lived and worked in Antwerp. His contribution to the development of a new genre, the independent landscape painting, was considerable. In his religious paintings, he placed his figures against a background of immense vistas presented as a bird's eye view of a host of cosmic elements: mountains and crags, sweeping valleys, rivers and meadows, towns and villages - one after the other they draw the eye of the beholder on to a distant horizon. Although these are not yet fully independent landscape paintings, the landscape is the most important element in his compositions. The human figures play only a secondary role, as can be seen in St Christopher bearing the Christ Child, a very popular subject at that time and on into the 17th century, because St. Christopher was believed to give protection against sudden death. There can be no doubt that Pieter Bruegel studied Patenier's landscapes before leaving for Italy and painting the Alps.",1501-1550,Oil on panel,200.0

Like many painters of the period, he uses landscape to create a suitable setting for the figures in his scenes. But although he integrates his narrative within them, his landscapes become more than mere backgrounds, and begin to assume their own autonomy. For the most part, Patenier maintains an equilibrium within his paintings between the presence of the figures and the landscape, and only in a few is he bold enough to shift this balance in favour of his vision of nature. His detailed technique is typical of Flemish artists, but his novelty lies in his creation of space and depth through subtle gradations of light and colour, as well as a certain effort at capturing the atmosphere of the scene.",1501-1550,Oil on panel,200.0

It shows a scene from the life of St Francis Xavier, one of the joint founders of the Jesuit Order, who during his mission in Japan brought a dead girl back to life. Summoned by the prayers of the saint, Christ appears in the company of angels and restores the deceased to the living. The painting offered Poussin the opportunity to measure himself against his arch rival Vouet, who - along with Poussin's friend Jacques Stella - had been commissioned to produce a work for one of the side altars. Poussin was not entirely happy, however, with the circumstances under which his altarpiece arose: it was the largest canvas he ever executed in terms of dimensions, and although he considered its composition a success he was obliged to complete it in a great rush.",1601-1650,Oil on canvas,200.0

In the background Joseph works away, unconcerned, at his carpentry. Mary, meanwhile, with a book in her hand, looks up from her reading and turns towards the Child, raising the cover that shields him from the firelight, to gaze at him or perhaps just to make sure he is all right.

It is not known whether Ribalta was aquainted with the work of Caravaggio or whether he arrived independently at results parallel to those achieved by the Italian Tenebrists. At all events, his style is remarkable for its virile naturalism. The brushwork is increasingly bold and free, so different from the polished smoothness of the previous age. Ribalta sought expressiveness as well as beauty and accentuated the sculptural modeling of his forms by contrasting light and shade. Among his better known works are the Last Supper in the Valencia Museum and the panels of the great altarpiece of Algemesi, painted in 1603; one of these, that depicting the martyrdom of St James, suggests a connection between Ribalta and Navarrete.",1601-1650,Oil on canvas,200.0

In Madrid, Ribalta experienced the Florentine naturalism of the Carducho brothers. (It is also possible that Pedro Orrente played a part in directing Ribalta toward a greater naturalism.) Indeed, his St Francis Comforted by a Musical Angel, painted around 1620 for an altar in the church of the Capuchinos of Valencia, is a direct descendant of Bartolome Carducho's Death of St Francis. This painting is purged of all vestiges of mannerism and uses the powerful force of light to enhance the presence of figures and objects alike.

In Ribera highly refined ecxecution and realistic modeling, particularly the marvelous flesh tints of his saints, are combined with a marked preference for dramatic themes, as may be seen in his St Andrew, in the Prado, or better in the painting of the martyrdom of the same saint, now in Budapest.

Paradoxically yet fittingly, Ribera has given him the flickering shadow of all-devouring ecstasy that predominates in a heightened form in his depictions of monks.

His work has often been mistaken for that of a follower of Raphael, so closely did he model himself on the 'pure' style of an earlier age. After he had copied some pictures for the Benedictine monastery in Perugia at the age of 21, he was introduced to a reformed Franciscan friary in Rome, the city in which he lived for some forty years and where he died.

In the St Matthew and the Angel, a subject appropriate for the Milanese mint insofar as the saint was a tax collector, an angel appears in the darkness to inspire the seated evangelist. Strangely distorting light and shadows play across their drapery and faces, the result of illumination from a small oil lamp placed like a footlight on the table below and in front of them. In the dark recesses at the right two men attend to a seated figure, probably St Matthew in the house of the Queen of Ethopia's eunuch after he had preached and discredited some local magicians. vFlames and sparks from the fireplace throw the three figures into relief, catching St Matthew's hands and face with their light, but consigning the rest of his body to near total darkness.

It was probably commissioned as a private altarpiece, and the conventional arched vertical format had never before, and has rarely since, been used to such dynamic and disturbing effect. The imagery also is unusual. The story of St George of Cappadocia, Roman officer and Christian martyr, was made popular in Western Europe through The Golden Legend, a calendar-book of tales of the lives of the saints compiled in the late thirteenth century. It is there that we find the story of a dragon terrorising the countryside demanding human sacrifice. When the fatal lot fell to Cleodolinda, the daughter of the king, St George, riding by on his charger, turned to help her and vanquished the dragon 'in the name of Christ'. In a departure from tradition, Tintoretto has shown the livid cadaver of a previous victim in the pose of the crucified Christ and included God the Father in the heavens blessing the victory of good over evil. The terrified princess, fleeing uphill from the dragon climbing out of the sea, nearly stumbles out of the foreground. St George has galloped into the painting from our right, the direction of a hidden source of light which picks out the trunks of the trees, the rump of the horse, the armour of the knight and the flesh and garments of Cleodolinda.",1551-1600,Oil on canvas,200.0

The monumental stairway indicates the musical connection; its 15 steps or ""grades"" refer to the 15 graduals, the psalms sung by pilgrims in annual temple processions. The singers' gallery above the organ was also painted by Tintoretto. The dark carving of the breastwork and the frames of the wings were partly gilded, like the stairway in the painting; Tintoretto picked out its undulating ornamentation in gold leaf. This ""Byzantine"" stylistic element is particularly effective in the shadowy area on the left, where it produces a sense of mystic illumination. The richly decorated steps on Mary's way into the temple are reminiscent of the Scala dei Giganti in the interior courtyard of the Ducal Palace, the lower section of which, like the stairway up to the temple, has 15 steps.

They may be the four archangels Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel, or they may symbolize the four theological virtues of the Love of God, Charity, Faith, and Hope. The two angels at the top, at least, were probably painted from the same three-dimensional model. Tintoretto intentionally places the golden key of heaven between St Peters thighs. Contemporary comedies leave us in no doubt about the erotic symbolism of the key. It was also the subject of the satirical piece La chiave (The Key) by Tintoretto's friend Anton Francesco Doni. Since Peter is clearly shown here as the first pope, this daring pictorial joke may be seen as evidence of the widespread anti-papal feeling in Renaissance Venice.",1551-1600,Oil on canvas,200.0

Notably devout, he was much in demand as a painter of altarpieces and reli- gious narratives for the churches and confraternities of his native Venice, and also executed many portraits. He modified his style and technique according to the commission. He sometimes deliberately imitated the style of other painters, but his ideal was said to be 'the drawing of Michelangelo and the colouring of Titian'. What is uniquely his own is his sense of drama, often verging on melodrama, expressed through violent movement and vertiginous shifts in scale, as figures plunge towards us or recede abruptly into the distance, and by lurid tonal or colour contrasts.",1551-1600,Oil on canvas,200.0

The saint is identified with great clarity by the presence of his symbols, a lion, cardinal's hat and books. The concept that the human being can only attain salvation by struggling fiercely with the weakness of the flesh through meditation and mortification, already evident in the behaviour of the saint, is underlined, at a deeper level of iconographic interpretation, by the harsh rocky landscape covered with wild scrub behind St Jerome, which would make it difficult to reach the flight of steps leading up to the plateau, occupied emblematically by a church and an obelisk, symbol of eternity.",1551-1600,Oil on canvas,200.0

Beginning at the organ, it included, besides the St Francis, an eccentrically formatted Adoration of the Magi at the centre, and, at the corners, the Four Evangelists, together with St Nicholas Named Bishop of Myra near the high altar. After the suppression of the Franciscans in 1806, the church was demolished and the pictures were dispersed.

The drawing is intended as a preparatory sketch, which causes the theme to be interpreted as taking place in real time, as well as emphasizing the artist's ability to record the divine, and thus, as it were, to prove its existence. The activity depicted in the painting probably reflects accurately the way in which, in the fifteenth century, a painted portrait was prepared by means of a preliminary drawing (the best-known example is Van Eyck's drawing with the portrait of Cardinal Albergati in Dresden).

At the same time, it picks up ideas from the great Deposition (Prado, Madrid): a ""living"" figure of the Virgin appears where a statue would normally stand, removed from any realistic or narrative environment. Any additional explanatory motifs - for instance the small painted sculptures present in other works - are absent from the Dur√°n Madonna, and the colours are restricted to only a few values. In her red robe, glowing with an unreal light, and framed in a sculptural niche, the Virgin appears withdrawn and majestic, though her loving attention to her son and the rough, childish way he is leafing through the book are very human touches in themselves.

The legend that he was a cardinal, and that during a reading to his disciples in Bethlehem he was approached by a limping lion with a thorn in its paw, only originated in the thirteenth century.

Removed from the great centers of Renaissance art, he was able to create a remarkably innovative body of work. This intimate devotional panel is a product of the artist‚Äôs youth. Here Correggio revealed his own evolving style while assimilating lessons from other masters. The panel‚Äôs pyramidal grouping of figures reÔ¨Çects the High Renaissance manner of Raphael, while their soft outlines and the Virgin‚Äôs enigmatic smile recall Leonardo da Vinci. The evocative use of the distant landscape demonstrates the young artist‚Äôs awareness of Northern European precedents. The gentle sensuousness of the figures and the tenderness they show one another through glance are unique to Correggio. The artist used light, shadow, and color to bathe the panel in a gentle glow; skin and fabrics appear to take on a velvety texture.

His art has long been considered the embodiment of the ideals of seventeenth-century classicism. In this painting, Saint John, one of the four Evangelists who wrote the Gospels of the New Testament, reclines beside his attribute, the eagle. He is here depicted as a powerful old man, presumably after retiring to the Greek island of Patmos to write his gospel and the book of Revelation at the end of his life. To suggest the vanished glory of the ancient world, Poussin carefully constructed an idealized setting for the saint, complete with an obelisk, a temple, and column fragments. Man-made and natural forms were adjusted according to principles of geometry and logic to convey the measured order of the scene. Even the profile view of Saint John is in harmony with the classical landscape. This painting may have been part of a projected series on the four Evangelists‚Äîin addition to this work, Poussin completed a companion, Landscape with Saint Matthew (1640; Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin).", 1640,Oil on canvas,200.0

The landscape below the saint is the setting for two narrative vignettes and a sacred allegory. On the left is the martyrdom of St. Barbara at the hands of a turbaned executioner who is struck by lightning as he swings his sword. Behind them is the tower where, according to legend, Barbara was sequestered by her pagan father in an unsuccessful effort to keep her from both suitors and Christian proselytizers. The tower‚Äôs three windows, one of which Barbara caused to be added, make symbolic reference to the Trinity.

The scene exemplifies St. Barbara‚Äôs role as patroness at the hour of death, intervening to assure that last sacraments are received. In the central scene, the Lamb of God (Agnus dei) stands on a mound at the center of an enclosed garden (hortus conclusus). The lamb bleeds into a chalice, which overflows in four streams (an allusion to the four rivers of Paradise) and irrigates the garden plots below. The phrase ""Vinum germinare faciens Virgines,"" inscribed above the lamb, is taken from the prophecy of Zacharias (9:17): ""For what is the good thing of him, and what is his beautiful thing, but the corn of the elect, and the wine springing forth virgins.""

He presumably trained in the northern Netherlands before establishing himself as an independent master in London around 1618. Combining fluid brushstrokes with a keen interest in the particularities of his sitters‚Äô features, Jonson created original likenesses that earned him a large number of commissions. His hallmark paintings of the 1620s and 1630s‚Äîelegant bust-length portraits occasionally set within a trompe l‚Äôoeil oval frame‚Äîstrongly appealed to the British gentry. His best portraits, including this sensitive rendering, nevertheless date from his later Dutch period (1643‚Äì1661). ",1657.0,oil on panel,200.0

Seated in the left foreground beside the sacrificial lamb, he wears the traditional, roughly cut pelt that is his attribute, and holds a reed cross. A thin banner winding around the cross bears the letters‚Ä¶ECC‚Ä¶AGN‚Ä¶a reference to the words John uttered when he saw Christ: ‚ÄúBehold the Lamb of God, behold him who taketh away the sins of the world‚Äù (Ecce agnus Dei, qui tollit peccatum mundi) (John 1:29). Under Reuter‚Äôs brush, this painting is not only an image of John preaching in the wilderness. It is also a psychological study of the crowd gathered around him. Reuter carefully individualizes the figures and their reactions. While many listen attentively with hands up in agreement or pressed to their faces in contemplation, others seem more reticent, such as the young girl in the center whose arms cross in front of her chest, evidently weary of John‚Äôs sermon.",1665.0,oil on canvas,200.0

In his works, a silvery light, softened and diffused by gentle clouds that spread across blue skies, quietly floods the gently rolling countryside, giving it an aura of age and venerability. His nuanced atmospheric effects were further enhanced by the inclusion of ancient ruins, which provided a visual and historical framework for the small-scale mythological and biblical figures that populate his landscapes, such as those seen in Christ Carrying the Cross. In this work, painted in Rome, he has adapted the ancient Tomb of Cecilia Metella on the Appian Way, built around 50 BC, into the large ruin on the right. ",1620.0,oil on copper,200.0

Identified on the basis of an inscription on a bust-length copy after this painting, Henry (1640‚Äì1660) was the third son of King Charles I and Queen Henrietta Maria. After virtual imprisonment during England‚Äôs civil war and Protectorate, Henry was permitted to join his older sister Maria Stuart and her husband, Willem II, Prince of Orange, in The Hague in 1652. The next year, Henry was invested as a Knight in the Order of the Garter, and that festive occasion likely led to the commission of this portrait by Adriaen Hanneman. The commanding pose of young Henry was probably chosen to stress the legitimacy and continuity of the Stuart dynasty despite the fact that Charles II, Henry‚Äôs brother, was in exile in Paris. At the Restoration in 1660, Henry accompanied Charles II back to England; he contracted smallpox soon thereafter and died that same year.",1653.0,oil on canvas,200.0

David deemphasized this miracle by giving Joseph a sturdy stick and by replacing the date palm with a Flemish chestnut tree, but a sixteenth‚Äìcentury audience would have remembered the apocryphal story. There are also indications of the special significance of the family: the Madonna wears robes in her symbolic colors of red and blue; fine rays of golden light emanate from the mother's head and that of the child; and the bunch of grapes held by the Madonna is a well‚Äìknown symbol of the Eucharist.",1510.0,oil on panel,200.0
